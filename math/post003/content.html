<p>Before proceeding let's confuse ourselves with several definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1:</strong> (Absolutely continuous measures) <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> are measures on a measurable space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{S})\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is <strong>absolutely continuous</strong> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = 0\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(\nu(A) = 0\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{S}\)</span>. This is often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\mu \ll \nu\)</span></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2:</strong> (Singular measures) <em>We say the measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is <strong>singular</strong> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, often denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu \perp \nu\)</span>, if there exists a set <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{S}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = \nu(\Omega - A) = 0\)</span></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 3:</strong> (Absolutely continuous functions) <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(-\infty &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>absolutely continuous</strong> if for all <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that for every finite disjoint collection <span class="math inline">\(\{(a_k, b_k)\}_{k=1}^{n}\)</span> of open intervals in <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span></em>, <span class="math display">\[\text{ if } \sum_{k=1}^{n}[b_{k} - a_{k}] &lt; \delta \text{ then } \sum_{k=1}^{n}|f(b_{k}) - f(a_{k})| &lt; \epsilon.\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Definition 4:</strong> (Singular functions) <em>A real-valued function is said to be <strong>singular</strong> if its derivative is 0 almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue measure <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have successfully abused some terminology, let's talk about the relationship between the Lebesgue decomposition theorems.</p>
<p>There are two forms of the Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem for Measures:</strong> (LDT1). <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-finite measures on a measurable space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{S})\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> can be decomposed as the sum of two measures, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\nu \ll \eta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \perp \eta\)</span>.</em> (<span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>)</p>
<strong>Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem for Functions of Bounded Variation:</strong> (LDT2). <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_variation">bounded variation</a>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be decomposed as the sum of two functions, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is absolutely continuous (in the sense of Definition 3) and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is singular (Definition 4). In particular, we can write</em>
\begin{equation}
g(x) := \int_{a}^{x}f&#39;\ dm \ \text{ and } \ h(x) := f(x) - \int_{a}^{x}f&#39;\ dm\ \text{ for all }x \in [a,b].
\label{1}
\end{equation}
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is of bounded variation, <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;\)</span> exists almost everywhere (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>). Hence the <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{1}\)</span> are well-defined.</p>
<p>Considering the overlap of terminology it is not surprising that these theorems are closely related. In fact LDT1, when restricted to the measurable space <span class="math inline">\(([a,b], \mathcal{B}[a,b])\)</span> and when the second measure is Lebesgue measure <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, can be seen as a special case of LDT2, where <span class="math inline">\(-\infty &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}[a,b]\)</span> denotes the Borel <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra over <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span>. More precisely, we can prove the following weaker version of LDT1 using LDT2.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> (Weak LDT1). <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is a finite measure on <span class="math inline">\(([a,b], \mathcal{B}[a,b])\)</span>. Then there exists (finite) measures <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(([a,b], \mathcal{B}[a,b])\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \nu + \lambda\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nu \ll m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \perp m\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Proof.\)</span> Without loss of generality assume <span class="math inline">\(a = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 1\)</span>. Let <span class="math display">\[ F(t) := \mu([0, t]), \ t \in [0,1], \]</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is non-decreasing, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is of bounded variation. Thus, by LDT2, we can decompose <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> as the sum of an absolutely continuous function <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and a singular function <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[ G(x) := \int_{0}^{x}F&#39;\ dm \ \text{ and } \ H(x) := F(x) - \int_{0}^{x}F&#39;\ dm. \]</span> First we will show that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are valid cdf's.</p>
<p><strong>Claim 1:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are non-decreasing and right-continuous.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Claim 1:</em> This is trivial for <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Now for <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in [0,1]\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; y\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is non-decreasing, <span class="math inline">\(\int_{y}^{x}F&#39;\ dm \leq F(x) - F(y)\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math display">\[ H(x) - H(y) = F(x) - F(y) - \int_{y}^{x} F&#39;\ dm \geq F(x) - F(y) - [F(x) - F(y)] = 0. \]</span> Therefore <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is non-decreasing. Now, by the right-continuity of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and the continuity of the integrand, <span class="math display">\[ \lim_{y\rightarrow x^{+}} H(y) = \lim_{y\rightarrow x^{+}} F(y) - \int_{0}^{y}F&#39;\ dm = F(x) - \int_{0}^{x}F&#39;\ dm = H(x). \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\blacksquare$ Claim 1}\]</span></p>
<p>By Claim 1, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are the cdf's of two measures, call them <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, respectively. More precisely, <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integration#Definition">Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures</a> generated by <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \nu + \lambda\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> is given explicitly by <span class="math inline">\(\nu(A) = \int_{A}F&#39; dm\)</span> (a good exercise is to verify this yourself, see <span class="math inline">\(**\)</span> below). Thus <span class="math inline">\(\nu \ll m\)</span>. Further, since <span class="math inline">\(H&#39; \equiv 0\)</span> a.e. (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(A) &gt; 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> contains a discontinuity point of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. But the discontinuity points <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> form a countable set (why is this?). Therefore <span class="math inline">\(0 = m(\mathcal{D}) = \lambda([0,1] - \mathcal{D})\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \perp m\)</span> by definition. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\Box$}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(*\)</span>) A nice proof of a general form of LDT1 can be found <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1871v1.pdf">here</a>.<br />
(<span class="math inline">\(**\)</span>) To show that <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = \nu(A) + \lambda(A)\)</span>, one could first show that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu&#39; := \nu + \lambda\)</span> agree over a suitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_system"><span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>-system</a>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, for which <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}[0,1] = \sigma\langle \mathcal{C} \rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\langle \mathcal{C} \rangle\)</span> denotes the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra generated by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> (the set of all subintervals of <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> is a good bet). Then, after verifying that <span class="math inline">\(\mu&#39;\)</span> is a valid measure, define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L} := \{A : A \in \mathcal{B}[0,1], \mu(A) = \mu&#39;(A)\}\)</span>. It is easy to show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynkin_system"><span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-system (aka Dynkin-system)</a>. Thus, it follows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_system#The_.CF.80-.CE.BB_Theorem"><span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> theorem</a> that <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \mu&#39;\)</span> on all of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}[0,1]\)</span>.</p>

<p>The relationship between definitions 1 &amp; 3 is also worth exploring. It turns out that in the special case of LDT1 described above, there is a deep connection between both definitions of absolute continuity. First take note of the following lemma.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma:</strong> <em>A function <span class="math inline">\(f : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> is absolutely continuous if and only if it is an indefinite integral.</em></p>
<p>The proof of this is straight-forward and can be found in Royden &amp; Fitzpatrick, <em>Real Analysis 4th Ed</em>, page 125.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is a finite measure on <span class="math inline">\(([a,b], \mathcal{B}[a,b])\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> denote the cdf of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\mu \ll m\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is absolutely continuous.</em></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Proof.\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((\Rightarrow)\)</span> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu \ll m\)</span>. Then by the Radon-Nikodym Theorem there is a non-negative, integrable function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[ \mu(A) = \int_{A}f\ dm \ \text{ for all } A \in \mathcal{B}[a,b]. \]</span> Thus <span class="math inline">\(F(x) = \int_{a}^{x}f\ dm\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in [a,b]\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is an indefinite integral, so <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is absolutely continuous by the lemma.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((\Leftarrow)\)</span> Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is absolutely continuous. Then by the lemma, <span class="math display">\[ F(x) = F(a) + \int_{a}^{x}F&#39;\ dm = \int_{a}^{x}F&#39;\ dm \ \text{ for all } x \in [a,b]. \]</span> It follows that <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = \int_{A}F&#39;\ dm\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{B}[a,b]\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math inline">\(m(A) = 0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(0 = \int_{A}F&#39;\ dm = \mu(A)\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\Box$}\]</span></p>
