<p>Before proceeding let's confuse ourselves with several definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1:</strong> (Absolutely continuous measures) <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> are measures on a measurable space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{S})\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is <strong>absolutely continuous</strong> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = 0\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(\nu(A) = 0\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{S}\)</span>. This is often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\mu \ll \nu\)</span></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2:</strong> (Singular measures) <em>We say the measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is <strong>singular</strong> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, often denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu \perp \nu\)</span>, if there exists a set <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{S}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mu(A) = \nu(\Omega - A) = 0\)</span></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 3:</strong> (Absolutely continuous functions) <em>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(-\infty &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>absolutely continuous</strong> if for all <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, there exists a <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> such that for every finite disjoint collection <span class="math inline">\(\{(a_k, b_k)\}_{k=1}^{n}\)</span> of open intervals in <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span></em>, <span class="math display">\[\text{ if } \sum_{k=1}^{n}[b_{k} - a_{k}] &lt; \delta \text{ then } \sum_{k=1}^{n}|f(b_{k}) - f(a_{k})| &lt; \epsilon.\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Definition 4:</strong> (Singular functions) <em>A real-valued function is said to be <strong>singular</strong> if its defivative is 0 almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue measure <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have successfully abused some terminology, let's talk about the relationship between the Lebesgue decomposition theorems.</p>
<p>There are two forms of the Lebesgue decomposition theorem (LDT): the first states that a measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> on a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-finite measure space can be decomposed as the sum of two measures, one of which is absolutely continuous (in the sense of Definition 1) and one of which is singular (Definition 2) with respect to another <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-finite measure <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> (LDT1), and the second states that a real-valued function of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_variation">bounded variation</a> defined on a closed and bounded interval <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span> can be decomposed as the sum of a function with is absolutely continuous (in the sense of Definition 3) and one of which is singular (Definition 4) (LDT2). Considering overlap of terminology it is not surprising that these theorems are closely related. In fact, LDT1 when restriced to the measurable space <span class="math inline">\(([a,b], \mathcal{B}[a,b])\)</span> can be seen as a special case of LDT2, where <span class="math inline">\(-\infty &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}[a,b]\)</span> denotes the Borel <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra over <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span>.</p>
