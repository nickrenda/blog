<p>A <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> over a set <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is a collection of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> such that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Omega - A \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\cup_{n=0}^{\infty}A_{n} \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2},... \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The concept of a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra provides a starting point for measure theory. Of course <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebras can be finite, like the trivial example <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} := \{\Omega, \emptyset\}\)</span>, or uncountably infinite (in most circumstances), like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra#Borel_and_Lebesgue_.CF.83-algebras">Borel <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra</a> over the reals which contains all open sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. However, a surprising consequence of the definition is that <em>countably</em> infinite <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebras cannot exist, as we will now prove.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Proof.\)</span> By way of contradiction, suppose there exists a set <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and a countably infinite <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. The objective right now will be to construct a countably infinite disjoint collection of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> such that every set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> can be expressed as the unique union of a subset of that collection. Once such a set is constructed, a contradiction easily follows by using Cantor's diagonal argument.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we first define the function <span class="math inline">\(f : \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{F}\)</span>, by <span class="math display">\[ f(x) := \bigcap\{E : E\in \mathcal{F}, x \in E\}, \]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Omega\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is countable by assumption, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Claim 1:</strong> The image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ A : A = f(x), x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span>, is a disjoint collection of sets.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Claim 1:</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \Omega\)</span>. We need to show that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(y)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \cap f(y) = \emptyset\)</span>. In order to derive a contradiction, assume that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \neq f(y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \cap f(y) \neq \emptyset\)</span>. Then there are two cases to consider. Either (i) <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \setminus f(y)\)</span>, or (ii) <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \cap f(y)\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \setminus f(y)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f(x), f(y) \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \setminus f(y) \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \setminus f(y) \subset f(x)\)</span>, which is a contradiction since <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the smallest set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> that contains <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now assume that <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \cap f(y)\)</span>. Well, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \cap f(y) \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \cap f(y) \subset f(x)\)</span>, which brings us to a contradiction again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since both cases lead to a contradiction, the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must be a disjoint collection of sets. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\blacksquare$ Claim 1}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Claim 2:</strong> Every set <span class="math inline">\(B \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> can be expressed as the countable union of a subset of the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Further, this representation of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is unique in the sense that there is only one collection of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is their union.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Claim 2:</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(B \in \mathcal{F}\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(x \in B\)</span>. Clearly <span class="math inline">\(x \in f(x) \subseteq \bigcup\left\{ f(y) : y \in B \right\}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq \bigcup\{ f(y) : y \in B \}\)</span>. Further, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \subseteq B\)</span> because if that was not true then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \cap B\)</span> would be a smaller set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> that contains <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which is a contradiction. So <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \subseteq B\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x \in B\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup \{f(y) : y \in B \} \subseteq B\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(B = \bigcup\{f(y) : y \in B\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fact that <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ f(y) : y \in B \right\}\)</span> is the unique collection of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is their union follows directly as a result of Claim 1, that the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a pairwise disjoint collection of sets. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\blacksquare$ Claim 2}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Claim 3:</strong> The image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span>, is countably infinite.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Claim 3:</em> Since <span class="math inline">\(\left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it cannot be uncountable. On the other hand, if <span class="math inline">\(\left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> was finite, then its power set would be finite. Thus, by Claim 2, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> would be finite since every set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> can be expressed as the unique union of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span>. This is a contradiction. Hence <span class="math inline">\(\left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> is countably infinite. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\blacksquare$ Claim 3}\]</span></p>
<p>As a result of Claim 3, we can enumerate <span class="math inline">\(\left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[ \left\{f(x): x \in \Omega \right\} = \left\{ A_{n} \right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}. \]</span> Now, let <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\omega}\)</span> be the set of all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's. Define <span class="math display">\[ g: \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\omega} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F} \]</span> by <span class="math display">\[ g\left( \left( a_{n} \right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \right) := \bigcup_{\{n : a_{n} = 1\}}A_{n}, \text{ for each } \left( a_{n} \right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}
\in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\omega}. \]</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is well-defined since <span class="math inline">\(\cup_{\{n:a_{n}=1\}}A_{n}\)</span> is a countable union of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is closed under countable unions.</p>
<p><strong>Claim 4:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a bijection.</p>
<p><em>Proof of Claim 4:</em> By Claim 1, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ A_{n} \right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\)</span> is a disjoint collection of sets, so the union of any collection of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ A_{n} \right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\)</span> is unique. Thus <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is one-to-one. Further, it follows as a corollary to Claim 2 that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is onto, since any set <span class="math inline">\(B \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> can be expressed as the union of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ A_{n} \right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a bijection. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\blacksquare$ Claim 4}\]</span></p>
<p>To wrap up, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor's diagonal argument</a> for the uncountability of the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> establishes that <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\omega}\)</span> is uncountable. This is where the contradiction arises, since by Claim 4 <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> has to be uncountable.</p>
<p>Therefore there does not exist a countably infinite <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra over the reals. <span class="math display">\[\tag*{$\Box$}\]</span></p>
