---

I am a third-year graduate student at Iowa State University pursuing a co-major PhD in Statistics and Mathematics.  In addition to having a strong mathematical background in analysis and measure theory, I am an extremely competent programmer in several different languages.  As a result I have a solid understanding of a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and the computing know-how to efficiently implement and deploy them.

Besides being a full-time student I work as a data scientist for a start-up called Structurely -- a company on the forefront of bringing artificial intelligence to the real estate industry.
