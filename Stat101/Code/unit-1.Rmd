### Misleading histograms

> Below is a histogram of a nice unimodal, bell-shaped, symmetric distribution... Right? Wrong. Adjust the binwidths and find out.

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("hist_widget.R")
set.seed(2)
x <- c(rnorm(1500,-1,2), rnorm(200,2.2,0.4))
hist_widget(x)
```

### The effect of skewness on mean and median

> This plot is meant to illustrate how the skewness of a distribution changes the relationship between the mean and the median. The mean is represented by the blue dashed line, while the median is the green dashed line.

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("skew_widget.R")
skew_widget()
```
