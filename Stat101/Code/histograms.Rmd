*With great power comes great responsibility. -Voltaire*

> The ability to visualize and analyzing data for trends and associations is vital in just about every field nowadays. The advancement in computers and software has made it possible for nearly anyone to create graphics from data and do some sort of statistical analysis. The ease and availability of these tools has been a great thing, for the most part. However, the ubiquitous access to such tools also means that data can easily be mishandled and misinterpreted.

### Histograms

> Below is histogram of a nice unimodal, bell-shaped, symmetric distribution... Right? Wrong. Adjust the binwidths and find out.


```{r defineWidget, echo=FALSE}
library(ggvis)
source("hist_widget.R")
set.seed(2)
x <- c(rnorm(1500,-1,2), rnorm(200,2.2,0.2))
widget(x)
```
