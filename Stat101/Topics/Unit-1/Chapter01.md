Chapter 01
========================================================
type: section

- What is statistics?
- What are data?
- The 5 W's of data
- Connecting the 5 W's to the data table
- Types of variables

Statistics
========================================================

- The field of statistics is about understanding data and making informed decisions
- Need to examine and understand variability to make decisions
- Our goal is to describe, quantify, explain, and/or predict variability in data

Statistics and Mathematics
========================================================

- Statistical theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with probability theory, linear algebra, numerical analysis, real analysis, etc..
- The application of statistics is something else, however
- This is class is not a mathematics course
- Focus is on conceptual understanding, on learning the important concepts in statistics. While we will do some computations by hand and using the computer, this is not the focus of Stat 101

What are data?
========================================================

- Pieces of information (values) collected about cases
    - Cases = people, places, things
        - Could contain all cases of interest (Population)
        - Could contain only a subset of cases of interest (Sample)
- Only meaningful in context
- Context: 5 W's
    - Who
    - What 
    - Where
    - When
    - Why

Who?
========================================================

- Cases: People, places, things
    - Population: All cases of interest, usually unobtainable
    - Sample: smaller collection of cases of interest, usually have this data
    - Sample population: no such thing! pick one or the other
- Rows in a data table
- Specify how many cases are in your data when identifying the "who"

What?
========================================================

- Pieces of information about the cases
- Variables - characteristics about each who
- Columns in a data table in JMP


Example
========================================================


```
                       name mpg horsepower
1 chevrolet chevelle malibu  18        130
2         buick skylark 320  15        165
3        plymouth satellite  18        150
4             amc rebel sst  16        150
5               ford torino  17        140
6          ford galaxie 500  15        198
```

Basic types of variables
========================================================

- Categorical variables
    - Recorded as labels (categories)
    - List of possible categories
    
***

- Quantitative variables
    - Recorded and used as numbers
    - Measurement units (ex. cm or inches)
    
Example: Colleges
========================================================


```
                             Private Apps
Abilene Christian University     Yes 1660
Adelphi University               Yes 2186
Adrian College                   Yes 1428
Agnes Scott College              Yes  417
Alaska Pacific University        Yes  193
Albertson College                Yes  587
```

Categorical variable?

Quantitative variable?

Where, When, Why, and How
========================================================

- Provides additional context to data
    - Not directly in the data table
- Questions to ask yourself
    - Where did the data come from?
    - When were the data collected?
    - How where the data collected?
    - Why were the data collected?
    
5 W's example
========================================================
incremental:true

- At the beginning of the semester, Stat 101 students have been asked to complete a general survey to obtain information about demographic and other variables in order to provide interesting examples to use during the course. Data were collected from Spring 2004 through Spring 2007 semesters from 2068 students.
- What is the population?
    - All Stat 101 students from the Spring 2004 through Spring 2007 semesters
- What is the sample?
    - Only Stat 101 students who completed the survey
- What are the 5 W's?
    
What the data looks like
========================================================

<center>

sex    | age    | year   | height  | eye color
------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ---------
female | 18     | first  | 68      | blue 
male   | 20     | third  | 70      | hazel
female | 18     | first  | 67      | green
male   | 22     | fourth | 62      | brown
...    | ...    | ...    | ...     | ...

</center>

> Rows are cases (students)

> Columns are variables (characteristics of students)
