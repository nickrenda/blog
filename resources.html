    <blockquote>
      <p><sub>The Yelp Academic Data set contians a wealth of information pertaining to 250 of the closest businesses to 30 large universities. Our analysis explores trends and characteristics in four different types of businesses, namely: restaurants, bars, hotels, and shopping centers. Some relationships are intuitive, others are not. For restaurants we find that people will pay a premium to eat at a place that accepts reservations, yet they are not necessarily paying for better quality food or service. There are also interesting links between noise level, whether a place delivers or offers takeout, and price level with number of stars a restaurant receives. For bars, we find that there are some relationships between the attributes of a bar that will determine what type of group will venture to that bar. We also find that most bars serve American food, though other foods are well represented too. For hotels and shopping centers, we discovered that higher prices are not correlated with higher ratings, and that people’s reviews are not much affected by whether the place has a parking lot nearby or free wifi.</sub></p>
