    <blockquote>
      <p><sub>The efficacy of the momentum strategy of investing in stocks, buying past winners and selling past losers, to produce abnormal returns is often cited as a counter-example for strict market efficiency. However, the advent of momentum mutual funds and exchange traded funds over the past decade has allowed us to analyze the success of actual momentum portfolios, finding that they have significantly underperformed the market. While transaction costs may explain much of the poor performance, the changing market betas and option-like behavior of the portfolios are also a factor, particularly following a prolonged market decline. As a result, it appears that momentum falls short in practice of disproving market efficiency</sub></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sub>The Yelp Academic Data set contians a wealth of information pertaining to 250 of the closest businesses to 30 large universities. Our analysis explores trends and characteristics in four different types of businesses, namely: restaurants, bars, hotels, and shopping centers. Some relationships are intuitive, others are not. For restaurants we find that people will pay a premium to eat at a place that accepts reservations, yet they are not necessarily paying for better quality food or service. There are also interesting links between noise level, whether a place delivers or offers takeout, and price level with number of stars a restaurant receives. For bars, we find that there are some relationships between the attributes of a bar that will determine what type of group will venture to that bar. We also find that most bars serve American food, though other foods are well represented too. For hotels and shopping centers, we discovered that higher prices are not correlated with higher ratings, and that people’s reviews are not much affected by whether the place has a parking lot nearby or free wifi.</sub></p>
